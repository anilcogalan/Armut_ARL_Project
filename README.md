## Armut Product Recommendation System with Association Rule Learning

```Business Problem```

* Armut, Turkey's largest online service platform, brings together service providers and those who want to receive service. It provides easy access to services such as cleaning, modification and transportation with a few touches on your computer or smart phone. It is desired to create a product recommendation system with Association Rule Learning by using the data set containing the service users and the services and categories these users have received.

```Data Set```

* The data set consists of the services customers receive and the categories of these services. It contains the date and time information of each service received.




```
# UserId: Customer number 

# ServiceId: Anonymized services belonging to each category. 
# (Example: Upholstery washing service under Cleaning category) 
# A ServiceId can be found under different categories and represents different services under different categories. 
# (Example: While the service with CategoryId 7 and ServiceId 4 is honeycomb cleaning, 
the service with CategoryId 2 and ServiceId 4 is furniture assembly) 

# CategoryId: Anonymized categories. (Example: Cleaning, shipping, renovation category) 

# CreateDate: The date the service was purchased
